## Hey! Welcome to my GitHub page.
### My name is Wilson Chen, and I am a current undergraduate attending Quinnipiac University. 
As of right now, I only know how to code in Java.


### I'm currently working on: 
##### Making my first 2D game following this YT playlist: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=om59cwR7psI&list=PL_QPQmz5C6WUF-pOQDsbsKbaBZqXj4qSq
##### A program that factors a quadratic equation with the form: ax^2 + bx + c; I will start with only a = 1.

### Other projects I want to get to:
##### A TicTacToe program.
##### Updating the Maze Solver program.
##### Hamming Distance calculator.
