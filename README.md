## Hey! Welcome to my GitHub page.
### My name is Wilson Chen, and I am a current undergraduate attending Quinnipiac University. 
As of right now, I only know how to code in Java.


### I'm currently working on: 
##### A TicTacToe program.
##### A program that factors a quadratic equation with the form: ax^2 + bx + c; I will start with only a = 1.
##### Updating the Maze Solver program.
##### Hamming Distance calculator.
